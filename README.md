Creative Souls- Covid secure confrence 

In this project, I have created a website based on the design of a conference website designed by 'Cindy Shin.
the website has two layouts one for mobile and one for bigger screens, it is informative with regards to the concert and also includes the design for purchasing a 
ticket for the desired date.
creating this website I tried to stay loyal to some of the designs and the patterns while introducing some of my own for creativity.
I have also applied animations in order to enhance the user's experience.
